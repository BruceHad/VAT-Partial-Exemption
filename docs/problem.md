VAT Partial Exemptions
======================

Some definitions:

_Inputs_ are basically purchases...spending on goods or services by the business. These purchase sometimes include VAT payments, which may be recoverable.

_Output_ or _Supplies_ both refer to _Sales_...a good or service the business sells. These can be taxable or exempt.

_Input Tax_ is therefore the tax (VAT) paid on purchases and _Output Tax_ is the tax paid on sales.

Businesses can generally recover VAT spent of purchases if those purchases related to **taxable** sales. That is, the government doesn't get to tax a product multiple times.  

A business is _partly exempt_ if it makes, or intends to make, both taxable and exempt supplies and incurs tax on costs which relate to both (that is, parts of the business are exempt but others are not).

If a business is partly exempt, it may not be able to recover all input tax. You will have to use a partial exemption method to work out how much input tax can be recovered.

_Taxable Input Tax_ is tax paid on Inputs that relate to Taxable **Outputs**. This is normally recoverable. 

Conversely, _Exempt Input Tax_ is tax paid on Inputs that relate to Exempt **Outputs**. These are not normally recoverable.

_Residual Input Tax_ is tax paid on Inputs that relate to both Taxable and Exempt supplies or on general business overheads. Generally only a portion of this is recoverable.

To calculate how much Input Tax the business can recover:

1. Direct attribution of input tax 
  * Taxable Input Tax - this can be recovered in full
  * Exempt Input Tax - this can only be recovered if certain criteria are met (see below for de _minimus criteria_)
2. Apportionment of residual input tax (see below for the _standard method_ of calculating the apportionment)

If the business meets the de minimis criteria (see below) they can also recover the Exempt Input Tax (i.e. they can recover 100% of Input Tax).

### The De Minimis Rules

1. Exempt Input Tax is less than £625 per month (averaged out over the quarter/year); and
2. Exempt Input Tax is less than 50% of total Input Tax

If both criteria are met, the Exempt Input Tax can be recovered.

### Standard Method for Calculating Apportionment of Residual Tax

We can calculate the percentage of Residual Tax that can be recovered:

    Taxable Portion = Value of Taxable Supplies / Total Values of Supplies x 100

Conversely:

    Exempt Portion = Value of Exempt Supplies / Total Values of Supplies x 100
	
Note, these values are net of VAT.

The recovery percentages calculated under the standard method must be rounded up to the next whole number unless you incur more than £400,000 of residual input tax each month on average in which case you must round to two decimal places.

### Quarterly/Yearly Calculations

The rules generally apply for a full year. i.e. a business can only recover all their Input Tax if they meet the de minimus criteria for the full year. 

But they are allowed to calcualate it quarterly and reclaim tax based on the previous three months.

In the fourth quarter, the calculation is applied for the full year.

If it turn out that any of the previous quarterly calculation was 'incorrect' adjustments can be applied to make up the difference.

In order to calculate De Minimis we need to calculate the _Exempt Inputs_, which are calculated as the VAT wholly attributable to _Exempt Supplies__ plus the _Exempt Residual VAT_.

The _Residual_ VAT is the VAT paid on general business expenses that cannot be attributed to either Exempt or Taxable supplies. It is therefore split into Exempt and Taxable based on the ratio of Exempt and Taxable _Total Supply_ (i.e the net sales).

_Total Input_ is all the VAT paid on all types of expenditure: Wholly Attributable + Attributable to Exempt + Residual.

### User Inputs


In order to calcualate all this we need the user to input:

1. The quarterly outputs (net sales) broken down by Exempt/Taxable (Standard + Zero Rated) 
2. Input VAT broken down by Taxable, Exempt and Residual

Quarterly Calculation
---------------------

(For quarters 1, 2 and 3)

Using the quarterly outputs/supply we can calculate the percentage exempt to be applied to the residual calculation.

* Exempt Residual VAT = Exempt Supply/Total Supply * Total Residual VAT

Then we calculate (for the quarter) the Exempt Input:

* VAT Attributable to Exempt Input +
* Exempt Residual VAT

Then we calculate (for the quarter) the Total Input:

* Wholly Attributable +
* Attributable to Exempt + 
* Total Residual

Then we can calculate the De Minimus:

1. Is the Exempt Input < (£625 * 3)
2. is the Exempt Input < (Total Input / 2)

If both True then De Minimus is True.

Yearly Calculation
------------------

(For quarter 4)

Using the quarterly outputs we can calculate the yearly total and therefore the yearly percentage exempt to be applied to the residual calculation.

Then we calculate (for the year) the Exempt Input:

* VAT Attributable to Exempt Input +
* Exempt fraction of the Residual

Then we calculate (for the year) the Total Input:

* Wholly Attributable +
* Attributable to Exempt + 
* Total Residual

Then we can calculate the De Minimus:

1. Is the Exempt Input < (£625 * 12)
2. is the Exempt Input < (Total Input / 2)

If both True then De Minimus is True.
